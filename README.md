# Telecom Churn Case Study

## Business Problem Overview:

In the highly competitive telecommunications industry, customers have the freedom to switch between service providers at will. This leads to an annual churn rate of 15-25%. Acquiring new customers is far more costly than retaining existing ones, with acquisition costs being 5-10 times higher. As a result, customer retention has become a primary business goal for many telecom operators.

For telecom companies, especially those with high-value customers, retaining profitable customers is crucial. Identifying and predicting which customers are at risk of churn allows companies to take proactive measures to prevent losing valuable clients.

This project focuses on the analysis of customer data from a leading telecom firm to build predictive models for identifying high-risk churn customers and determining the key indicators contributing to churn.

## Understanding and Defining Churn:

Telecom operators offer two primary models of payment: postpaid and prepaid.

Postpaid Model: In the postpaid model, customers receive monthly or annual bills after using services. Churn is easier to track in this model since customers must notify the operator when they intend to switch.

Prepaid Model: In contrast, prepaid customers pay in advance for services. These customers can switch to another operator without prior notice, making it challenging to detect churn, as some may stop using services temporarily or might be traveling abroad.

Thus, churn prediction is especially critical for prepaid customers, where it is harder to distinguish between a temporary hiatus and a permanent switch.


## Definitions of Churn:

Churn can be defined in several ways:

Revenue-based Churn: Customers who have not utilized revenue-generating services like mobile internet, outgoing calls, or SMS over a given time period. A possible metric could be customers who generate less than INR 4 in total monthly revenue.

Limitation: This definition excludes customers who may only receive calls or texts from family members but don't actively generate revenue.
Usage-based Churn: Customers who have not engaged with the service (no incoming or outgoing calls, no internet usage, etc.) for a specific period.

Limitation: If churn is defined based on a “two-month no usage” period, the prediction may be ineffective, as customers who have already stopped using the service cannot be influenced to return.
For this project, usage-based churn will be the chosen definition.

## High-value Churn:

In India and Southeast Asia, approximately 80% of the revenue is generated by 20% of the customers, referred to as high-value customers. Reducing churn among these high-value customers is vital to minimizing revenue loss.

In this project, high-value customers will be defined as those who have recharged with an amount greater than or equal to the 70th percentile of the average recharge amount over the first two months (the "good phase").

## Understanding the Business Objective and Data:

The goal of this project is to predict churn in the fourth month (September) using customer data from the first three months (June, July, and August).

Customer behavior typically progresses through three phases in relation to churn:

1. The ‘Good’ Phase: Customers are satisfied with the service, using it as expected.
2. The ‘Action’ Phase: Customer satisfaction declines, potentially due to receiving better offers from competitors, experiencing service issues, or other dissatisfaction.
3. The ‘Churn’ Phase: The customer has completely switched operators or ceased using services.
In this project, the data from the first two months will correspond to the "good phase," the third month to the "action phase," and the fourth month to the "churn phase."

## Dataset and Data Dictionary:

The dataset provides customer-level information for four consecutive months (June, July, August, September), with month identifiers (6, 7, 8, 9) representing each month.

The data dictionary provides meanings for various abbreviations such as IC (incoming), OG (outgoing), T2T (telecom-to-telecom), T2O (telecom-to-other), and RECH (recharge).

Key steps for data preparation:

Feature Engineering: Create new features based on business understanding that might help predict churn.
Filter High-Value Customers: Define high-value customers as those whose recharge amounts in the first two months exceed the 70th percentile.
Tag Churners: Tag customers who have churned (defined by no usage in the churn month), and remove attributes specific to the churn phase.
## Modelling:

The objectives of this model are:
1. To predict whether a high-value customer will churn in the future (in the churn phase).
2. To identify key variables that predict churn, offering insights into why customers switch providers.
3. A dimensionality reduction technique, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), may be used due to the large number of variables. Following PCA, various classification models will be trained to predict churn, and techniques to address class imbalance (since churn rates are typically low) will be employed.

Key steps for modeling:
1. Preprocess Data: Handle missing values, convert columns to appropriate formats, and normalize the data as needed.
2. Exploratory Analysis: Identify trends and correlations that may help in modeling.
3. Feature Engineering: Derive additional features based on business insights and data analysis.
4. PCA for Dimensionality Reduction: Reduce the number of features to improve model performance and reduce overfitting.
5. Model Training and Evaluation: Train various models (e.g., decision trees, logistic regression, etc.), tune hyperparameters, and handle class imbalance using techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or using balanced classification algorithms.
6. Evaluation Metrics: Choose metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, with a focus on precision and recall for churn prediction, since identifying churners is more critical than identifying non-churners.
7. After building the churn prediction model, we will also create a separate model (using logistic regression or decision trees) to identify the most important features that influence churn. These features will be visualized to convey their importance in customer churn.

## Recommendation:

Based on the findings from the analysis, strategies to mitigate churn will be suggested. These strategies may include targeted promotions, improved customer service, personalized offers, and adjustments to the pricing model to retain high-value customers.
